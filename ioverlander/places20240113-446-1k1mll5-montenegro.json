It’s private, only occasionally I hear hikers on the road hundred meters or so from here (no cars drive there at all, the road has been superseded by a bigger road much further away). There is a construction site a few hundred meters away, they are building a cable car station and a park or something, so maybe the place won’t be as private in the future.\r\n\r\nI only get 1-2 bars cell phone reception, but it still works fine to browse internet and stream video.","location":{"latitude":42.391,"longitude":18.80094},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":238523,"name":"Viewpoint Buljarica","date_verified":"2023-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Some kind of resting place with a gorgeous view. There are benches with tables and grills. I stayed from 17:00 Thursday to 10:00 Saturday and saw about 10 people. Mix between hikers, paragliders, and one couple coming by car to enjoy the view for a bit. No cars passing by to go somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThe ground is not suitable for tents, but it looks like you might be able to pitch a tent if you walk 100m along the hiking trail. No shade there though.
