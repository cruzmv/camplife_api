Stayed one night with bike. Payed 80  Danish kronas. Absolutely love the vibe. Very friendly people all around. After i was shown my camping spot I noticed a fire place and asked for some fire wood. I insisted to be charged for the wood but owner refused to take money. This place is not for everyone. Rough on the edges. Read reviews on google and you will get the idea. \r\nFor me the bad bit was the motorway noise that was fighting with crickets.","location":{"latitude":55.46486,"longitude":11.94471},"category":{"name":"Established Campground"}},{"id":243971,"name":"Camping Absalon","date_verified":"2023-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Large, well equipped , established campground.
