So after getting the exit stamp of Ukraine go to the Moldovan registration bureau directly (literally 3m) behind the Ukrainian costum service when exiting Ukraine. The procedure is easy: Go to their little cabin (you can´t miss it, it should be at the end of lane 3 or 4) and you´ll get the stamp.\r\n\r\nIf you are entering Transnistria by car you have to pay a tax (4 USD for our VW T4, you can also pay with EUR, UAH ...). So before qeueing in the line for the regular immigration drive to the left after crossing the river and you´ll see a building with two floors. Just go inside on the first floor to counter 1, get a piece of jotting paper on which they write the amount you have to pay, take it to counter 3, pay ... that´s it. Immigration itself is super relaxed, but make sure you have the paper for the tax. Otherwise you have to turn back when you arrive at costums control (so happened to us).\r\n\r\nAll in all an interesting border with nice people and very quick and uncomplicated (no car check at all) ;)","location":{"latitude":46.73542,"longitude":29.97177},"category":{"name":"Customs and Immigration"}},{"id":70149,"name":"Dream House Hostel","date_verified":"2019-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Nice hostel with super helpful and interested staff.

I even brought minimal camping gear and left the rest of my stuff at the hotel and took off for 2 days for some wild camping on the next Ridgeline over from this mountain range.\r\n\r\nthe owners are super friendly and definitely off-road enthusiast. I met a few new Czech friends who where here at this hotel the 9th time for a week long motorcycle vacation. If you have any problems with your bike the hotel has a covered parking area and plenty of tools they are more than happy to lend you. Should you need any parts they have some friends nearby that can get just about anything you need.\r\n\r\nSingle Room: 15 Euros a night\r\nDinner: 150-250 Ukrainian\r\n\r\na single room having a huge bed with hot shower and bathroom is 15 Euros a night including a pretty hardy breakfast. they have 3 and 4 bed rooms but not sure of the prices of those as I'm just one person. it's also possible to camp at this property as well in the garden next to the creek that runs through the property. I'm sure this is a cheap option but I forgot to ask the price to pitch a tent. if you do camp you might be woken up around 8 in the morning by the grazing goats nearby who have bells around their necks. \r\n\r\na very large and delicious dinner is served in the resorts restaurant every night. it's usually grilled BBQ or fish with potatoes and salad of some kind. if your into veggie meals they do that as well. the dinners cost anywhere from 150-250 grivna per meal.\r\n\r\nthey also have beer for 50 grivna a half liter on tap. juice, coffee, and sodas as well. \r\n\r\nthey have a sauna in the hotel as well as a cold dipping pool filled up by the river. they also have a pressure washer which they will let you use to clean your vehicle off with after you go out playing in the mud.\r\n\r\nno one speaks English here however they do speak Russian Ukrainian and Czech. I would highly recommend to agree on a price before moving in because I was told 15 euros a night but wanted to pay in Ukrainian money as I didn't have Euros so we had to work out the conversation rate. they don't take card sooooooo bring plenty of cash because most places in this area are cash only. I stayed 5 days and wild camped for a night in the near by mountains. this was my total for my time at the hotel:\r\n\r\n3900 grivna total for:\r\n\r\n5 nights single bed room\r\n5 dinners\r\n5 breakfasts\r\n2 soup lunches\r\n6 liters of boxed juice\r\n8 draft beers\r\n1 coffee\r\n\r\nhighly recommend the hotel as well as exploring this area of Ukraine if you're on a motorcycle or 4x4. amazing beautiful.

Aaand quite possibly of my life!!! I got to spend the night in what was an active intercontinental nuclear ballistic missile silo \r\n\r\nThe Tour costs $12 USD!\r\n\r\nI held the A.C.T.U.A.L. key that could have ended the world. If that isn't cool... I don't know what is.\r\n\r\nThis was not your average tour... This wasn't even supposed to happen.... But it did!!!\r\n\r\nAfter a long day on the bike I show up close to dark at what I think is just a Soviet military museum in the middle of no where... Negative...... 30 years ago this was the most strategic and secure point in the entire USSR!!!!!\r\n\r\nWith the input of a secret ever-changing code, a flick of 2 separate switches, and the simultaneous turn of 2 keys less than 10 feet (3m) apart a nuclear warhead could reach the United States in less than 22 minutes \r\n\r\nThis former Soviet base contains 3 missile silos that were just over 140 feet (43m) under ground. Each individual silo was covered by a hatch that weighed 14 tons! This hatch could open fully in just 8 seconds!!! In 1959 the construction of this base started in the early fall.... In the summer of 1960 it was fully operational! In less than one year the Soviets built and engineered this entire base.\r\n\r\nAt the time this base was completed it had state of the art computers which were also underground in a room that was big enough to be used as a warehouse... 85 percent of the cooling capacity of the liquid helium refrigerators was used solely to cool this behemoth of a computer!!! The smart phone you have in your hand right now has 20 times more computing power than this Soviet cutting edge 60's tech.\r\n\r\nThe missile... Let's talk about that little guy.... It had a range of 15,500 miles (25,000km) which was more than enough to reach out and touch the States just about anywhere the Red Army wanted to. It's minimum range was 1,200 miles (2,000km) \u0026 this was important incase they fancied an attack on the UK, France ooooor Western Germany. It carried a warhead 37 times stronger than that was dropped on Hiroshima! The missile herself weighed so much the Soviets had to manufacture a truck capable of carrying so much weight with multiple electric motors in each wheel... There were 24 wheels..... All with their own motor to help the diesel powered truck up the hills and down the highway.\r\n\r\nThey also had a secret train which was used to carry missiles thought the USSR... Very under the radar because there's trans were made to look old and busted... The only way you would know these were not normal passenger cars as they passed you on the tracks were the fact they had 4 wheels instead of 2 at each end of the train cars... Because the weight of the missiles works have crushed a single axle train.\r\n\r\nThe Soviets had to move, install, and seal up the missile in her silo in less than 2 hours or the Americans with our satellites would know what these commies were up to. Which could have very easily caused the cold war to go hot... Damn hot!\r\n\r\nAfter the soldiers who guard this base gave me the nickel tour which lasted 3 times as long as it should have I asked them if it was ok to camp in front of the base... They told me no it was not buuuuuut I was more than welcome to have a bed in their barracks, share some cognac, and have dinner with them.\r\n\r\nThese soldiers work a 3 day shift of 24 hours and rotate out every week. They were great guys and incredible friends! We talked about my time in Iraq \u0026 Afghanistan as well as their time in Afghanistan...
