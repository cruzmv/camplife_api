The train takes you to Hamburg city center in approx. 40 minutes. 10 minutes walk to the Elbe river. Municipal pool and sauna opposite of site.\r\nThe site is placed nicely and quiet in a green area of the town. The large open space may look a little dull and you could question the justification of a €10 overnight charge as the place has no further amenities than those mentioned above. But the town of Wedel offers a full range of services, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.. The walk down to the beaches of the river Elbe, a visit of the beach club \"28°\" or the ships welcome point \"Willkomm Höft\" is always worth it. The pool (indoor and outdoor) and sauna \"Badebucht\" opposite of the site is just great, both for kids and adults. And the train takes you in 40 minutes to downtown Hamburg. This may seem long, but there are only very few quiet RV sites available in this second biggest German town.

There is a tiny store, I have not used it as there are supermarkets nearby. \r\n\r\nMinus points:\r\n- When it rains, draining the water away can be problematic, water puddles appear.\r\n- Even though the camping site is located at the edge of the city, there is a some background noise.
