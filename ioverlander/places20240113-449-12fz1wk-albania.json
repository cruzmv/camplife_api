Departure time in Koman is 9:00 and in Fierze at 13:00. Travelltime is about two and a half hours. It is a very scenic boat trip.\r\nTickets in adavance you can book online. Check ww.komanilakeferry.com.\r\nComing from Fierze there is a ticket seller at the roundabout in Fierze village. Here you can get the ticket and a reservation before heading to Valbona valley. You can also change departure date if required. Ask the ticket seller for his phone/WhatsApp number. There is another ticket seller on the way to the jetty (about 3km out off Fierze) and also at the 'harbour' itself.\r\nPrice (ticket seller, online is supposed to be a bit cheaper): footprint of the car (length multiplied with width, in squaremeter sqm): €6,00/sqm including driver, extra person add €6,00. Our van (10sqm) with two persons was €66. If they ask the price in Lek check the conversion rate. It seemed to me that price in € is better than in Lek.\r\nAdditionally there is a harbour fee of Lek200 that we had to pay at the harbour on day of travelling (seems a bit strange but we even got an official receipt).\r\nAttention: Leaving the ferry in Koman you immediately proceed into a tunnel. So if you you want to rest at the pier be prepared.

At the time of my visit there was three options available and I ended up staying at this place which I kind of regret in the end. \r\n\r\nAll of them cost 10€ the night and 5€ for breakfast and 5€ for dinner. I don’t know much of the very last place at the end of the road but it was very crowded that time so I kept on searching. The second place (the very first one to the left) was nice and with a huge flat area for camper vans. Also some shady trees. Rooms are everywhere same same - simple beds for up to 5. Only downside there was the room in the second floor and since I didn’t want to carry all my wet stuff up I kept on searching. \r\n\r\nNow comes the weird thing. Once I told them at the place I stayed in the end that I am going to pay with my last Lekë (1500 which is even more then 10€ and another 5€, also my last cash, for the dinner) there mood changed quite to the negative. They started a huge discussion about it for minutes. At a certain moment I just didn’t care anymore and decided to take it as it is. I really didn’t see the problem.\r\n\r\nThe road itself is just mindblowing. The village is really nothing special.
