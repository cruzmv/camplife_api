Before you're even allowed to enter the Border crossing, you have to get a ticket for the electronic queue. It is a parking lot located a few kilometers before the crossing. When we drove there was no one there so we kept on driving. But at the crossing we weren't allowed in and had to turn back and get the ticket for 11,2 BYN.\r\n\r\nWith the ticket we could proceed and go to customs. There was some kind of complication as there was a huge line for clearing the vehicles. When it was our turn, we had to give the drivers passport, the vehicle registration and the customs declaration that was filled out when we crossed into Belarus. Afterwards the officer will look inside the vehicle and give back the documents.\r\n\r\nBefore going to immigration you have to pay 37 BYN for road tax. But the bank in the border was closed from 20:00 until 21:15 when we were crossing. You can pay the road tax at every branch of Belarusbank in the country, so maybe consider paying it before crossing.\r\n\r\nAt the immigration you just give them the passport, vehicle insurance, the receipt for the road tax and the completed customs declaration. Afterwards you are free to go to the Latvian side of the border.\r\n\r\nOn the Latvian side you wait in the vehicle until an immigration officer comes and will take your passport, vehicle registration, drivers licence and has a look on the green card insurance. Then you go to immigration booth, where your passport is checked. After immigration you will be sent to the customs booth where you just have to give the vehicle registration. After that the vehicle is inspected and with that you're free to enter Latvia.","location":{"latitude":55.71807,"longitude":26.87367},"category":{"name":"Customs and Immigration"}}]
