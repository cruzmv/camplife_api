You also don’t have to pay per adult or any of that crap. \r\n\r\nThe guy that runs it is super friendly and if you pull up to the barrier he will let you in and show you where to park. \r\n\r\nThe pitches aren’t huge but certainly enough to set up your awning etc.\r\n\r\nThere is a pizzeria right next door which I would totally recommend, it’s cheap and the pizza is molto bene!\r\n\r\nThe location is great because you’re right next to the lake but you will need to cycle about 10/15 minutes into town or get a quick bus/taxi (there are loads) down the road. This means it’s great to access the rest of the lake if you spend a day exploring.\r\n\r\nToilet and shower facilities were nothing incredible but totally acceptable (especially for the cheap price) and it has waste disposal + fresh water etc.\r\n\r\nThere is free WiFi available in a shelter by reception which is pretty decent but it likely won’t stretch to the rest of the site.\r\n\r\nAll in all I would definitely come again and totally recommend as a cheap way to stay and explore beautiful Garda!
