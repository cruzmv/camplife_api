Rooms are what you'd expect for a hostel.  Bunk beds, ensuite toilet and shower, it was in  my bunkroom at least.  The only minor niggle with the bunks being that the top bunk was too low to maker sitting on the bottom bunk comfortable.  Great facilities in the ground floor communal area and a good kitchen.  Super market near by and easy access to the regular, reliable bus service to take you to old town, where it all seems to happen otherwise it's maybe  an hour's walk.

There's also a pedestrianised street nearby with the usal assortment of restaurants/cafes.  Prices throughout Dubrovnik seem higher than others in Croatia.  There's a vespa dealer in town (moto Centar Dubrovnik) which has some limited stock of bulbs, oils etc..  The best part of the hostel are the hosts.
