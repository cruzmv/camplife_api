At the sign of the golf course turn right and follow the road across the golf course (don’t hesitate, it’s just old people playing golf, they don’t bite). At the end of the golf course you will cross a small bridge. Right after the bridge, turn sharp left. There will be a sign “Privat. No parking.” That belongs to David. Keep going 10m more and you will see his property on the right hand side.
