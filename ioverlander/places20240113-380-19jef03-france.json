There are a few bits of wire and pieces of old metal, be cautious not to pinch your tires. Spent a quiet night there and were not bothered by anyone. Don't know about the main season though.

Small wildcamping spot for 1 jeep/van/small campervan just inside the treeline. Or one bit bigger camper but you have to stay on the track into the forrest. Carefull if you have a long backend sticking out, there is a small ditch when you enter the forrest.\nYou can follow the track a small ways for about 50m over a small hill and there is another spot for one camper, more out of sight of the gravel track but its less level.\nNo ammeneties but a wunderfull sunrise one the snowcapped mountain in the distance 😍\n","location":{"latitude":43.14125573178024,"longitude":-0.0575328876573101},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":257484,"name":"Free parking nearby Mont st.
