This spot on the edge of the water is accessible by 4x4 trail, not too difficult when dry. The spot has a few fire pits and could house up to five 4x4s on flat pitches. When we were there the place was empty. The reservoir is good for swimming, though there aren't real beaches around (marsh-like). We suspect this is not private property, but owned by the reservoir. All of the few passers-by were very friendly.","location":{"latitude":50.95923202021025,"longitude":21.143766967011526},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":136365,"name":"Zalew Książ","date_verified":"2020-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Parking spot on the bank of Pool for some 10 vans.","location":{"latitude":50.439763795631414,"longitude":20.14654557222514},"category":{"name":"Short-term Parking"}},{"id":136429,"name":"86 Gear Motorcycle shop","date_verified":"2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","description":"small motorcycle shop with a very knowledgeable mechanic. oil changes, suspension work, restoration, welding, modifications, troubleshooting, electric work. has access to many motorcycle parts for all year bikes","location":{"latitude":52.22234779,"longitude":20.96971118},"category":{"name":"Mechanic and Parts"}},{"id":136622,"name":"Wild camping in the forest","date_verified":"2023-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A nice spot in the forest close to Łódź and very close to the highway.","location":{"latitude":51.57167088470481,"longitude":19.556990493322953},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":136802,"name":"Wild spot near Warta River","date_verified":"2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Great open spaces.

We were further asked about our travel plans in Belarus and our past destinations especially Ukraine. \r\n\r\nAfterwards you go to the Belarus customs. We had to go to the red channel for our car. You first have to wait until your license plate will appear on a screen next to your assigned customs booth. Once there you have to fill out 2 copies of the vehicle declaration. As I don’t speak Russian the customs lady helped me fill it out. Then you have to empty your car and put all your things on a desk next to the car. They will check everything and they brought a dog to go around our car. Then you can put your stuff back in the car and have to wait until the lady brings your passport and vehicle registration with the completed customs declaration and you’re free to enter Belarus. \r\n\r\nPS: Dont use this crossing when going from Belarus to Poland.
