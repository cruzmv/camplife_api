It's on a hill, with a view over the sunset and the valley. No houses nearby, but the sounds of traffic are noticeable and the cars are visible. Locals do drive this small road now and then (and stopped to enjoy the view), but it was so calm and safe I didn't bother covering any windows.\r\nPlenty of forest downhill on the other side for relieving oneself. There's trash around, you can do good by taking a few with you. A mouse(?) walked on my roof at night, wouldn't leave food out!","location":{"latitude":45.141137,"longitude":24.591747},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":244599,"name":"Private spots riverside","date_verified":"2023-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","description":"On the north side of the river is an unpaved road not visible on maps. It begins downhill right next to Hidrocentrala Arpaşu, which you can put on Google Maps. \r\nThere are a lot of spots to camp, high clearance/4x4 helpful. Locals were fishing/having picnics along here, but I drove to the end of the road and didn't set eyes upon another human during my 2-night stay. Very private. No 3G/4G, but signal works mostly.\r\nDifficult to turn at the very end, I recommend walking the road first if unsure if your vechicle can go there, but a bit before the end there is a wider area more suitable for turning. Please take some trash with you!","location":{"latitude":45.792413,"longitude":24.587613},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":244859,"name":"Roadside","date_verified":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Good place for motorbike câmp.
