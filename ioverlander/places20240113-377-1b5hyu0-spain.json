Even though my motorcycle was bought \u0026 registered in Belgium (EU), customs insisted that any cargo arriving at the terminal needs to be cleared by means of an import declaration - something I didn't expect, since \"it's just a Belgian bike re-entering in the EU\". Also the fact that I didn't have an export declaration seemed to be an issue for them (I didn't ask for that when leaving the Bulgarian border, not even sure if you can get it there).\r\n\r\nI went to some customs agencies, and \"Jesa Cargo Aduanas\" saved my day! Because of uncertainties (which codes to use, how to declare for a non-resident, how to import tax-free without an export document), Jesus went along to the customs office to discuss the matter with the officials directly - he knows everybody there. \r\n\r\nThe issue was quickly resolved:\r\n- use code C08 - 101 for tax free import - the agency will know what this is, and this was confirmed by the customs officials themselves\r\n- get yourself registered in the customs system as a non-resident by means of your passport\r\n\r\nShortly after, Jesus filed the import declaration, and all was resolved. He really went out of his way to help me out, he's very knowledgeable, and just an overall great guy! He charged me 80 euros, what seemed a very reasonable price to me (other agencies quoted up to 325 euros + VAT, for the same job, and I'm sure they didn't really know what to do).\r\n\r\nSo if you're facing the same issue, go see Jesus!

But we can also provide translation assistance or assistance in hospitals / medical centres. We have been the contact for medical emergencies on cruise ships in the region for several years. We know that in such situations it can be very difficult to cope in a country you don't know like your own. \r\nAs we have lived in Spain for 15 years and speak English and French as well as Spanish, we are prepared for many situations. \r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nAvec notre garage entièrement équipé et nos années d'expérience, nous proposons toutes les réparations à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de votre habitat overlander ou camping-car. Remplacer les fenêtres, réparer les pompes à eau, changer les charnières, installer des panneaux solaires ou autre. Comme nous construisons notre propre Overlander, nous sommes également heureux de discuter avec un café. Nous ne réparons pas les pièces mécaniques de votre voiture, mais connaissons quelques ateliers très bons et bon marché. \r\n\r\nVous pouvez utiliser notre adresse comme adresse de livraison pour Amazon, par exemple. Mais nous pouvons également fournir une aide à la traduction ou une assistance dans les hôpitaux / centres médicaux. Depuis plusieurs années, nous sommes le contact pour les urgences médicales sur les bateaux de croisière dans la région. Nous savons que dans de telles situations, il peut être très difficile de se débrouiller dans un pays que vous ne connaissez pas comme le vôtre. \r\nComme nous vivons en Espagne depuis 15 ans et que nous parlons l'anglais et le français ainsi que l'espagnol, nous sommes préparés à de nombreuses situations. \r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nMit unserer voll ausgestatteten Werkstatt und jahrelanger Erfahrung bieten wir alle Reparaturen innerhalb und außerhalb Ihres Overlander- oder Wohnmobil-Lebensraums an. Fenster austauschen, Wasserpumpen reparieren, Scharniere wechseln, Solarpaneele installieren oder was auch immer es sein mag. Da wir unseren eigenen Overlander bauen, sind wir auch gerne bereit, bei einem Kaffee zu plaudern. Wir reparieren keine mechanischen Teile Ihres Autos, kennen aber einige sehr gute und günstige Werkstätten. \r\n\r\nSie können unsere Adresse als Versandadresse für z.B. Amazon verwenden. Wir können aber auch Übersetzungshilfe oder Hilfe in Krankenhäusern / medizinischen Zentren leisten. Wir sind seit mehreren Jahren Ansprechpartner für medizinische Notfälle auf Kreuzfahrtschiffen in der Region. Wir wissen, dass es in solchen Situationen sehr schwierig sein kann, in einem Land zurechtzukommen, das man nicht so gut kennt wie sein eigenes. \r\nDa wir seit 15 Jahren in Spanien leben und sowohl Englisch und Französisch als auch Spanisch sprechen, sind wir auf viele Situationen vorbereitet.","location":{"latitude":36.27921,"longitude":-5.30995},"category":{"name":"Mechanic and Parts"}},{"id":167445,"name":"cliff close to oilrig","date_verified":"2022-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","description":"here are at least three different spots where you can stay. check the pictures and the red line. its close to the oil rig. for the initial entrance check the other spot here on ioverlander. no shades. you can walk to the beach, its a stone beach, no sand. you need a good ground clearance but not neccessary 4wd.","location":{"latitude":28.092276809792583,"longitude":-16.48809072155362},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":167454,"name":"natural pools","date_verified":"2022-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","description":"some natural pools. good for a swim. a lot of people here.","location":{"latitude":28.029334470405576,"longitude":-16.582494276570973},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":167570,"name":"Small Laguna","date_verified":"2022-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","description":"nice place with a view. also good for a swim. a lot of people. here is also a parking space where you can stay for a night","location":{"latitude":28.400152301986573,"longitude":-16.672824220450554},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":167701,"name":"beach place","date_verified":"2023-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","description":"a lot of space, a lot of other campers. easy accessible. wind protected","location":{"latitude":28.095084550111526,"longitude":-16.48374342614182},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":167722,"name":"Ifonche","date_verified":"2022-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","description":"a lot of space with an amazing view. here is also a paragliding start point. can be very windy since you are on top of a hill. easy accessible.","location":{"latitude":28.128837855398995,"longitude":-16.691593174666547},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":167759,"name":"Tent spot in pine trees","date_verified":"2022-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","description":"From the pullout walk to the electrical line tower and then look down to your left.
