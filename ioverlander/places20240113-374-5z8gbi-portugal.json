Along these roads there are heaps of fairly level pull outs, some sheltered, some in the open. Some roads are closer to the actual road but still far away enough to hear any noise. These roads are used by local fisherman to get to the cliffs where you can walk down via stairs (great to check out). Insane panoramic views! The marker i’ve put on the map, is a bigger pull out (but with big rocks) higher than the rest sheltered from the western winds. Enjoy!
